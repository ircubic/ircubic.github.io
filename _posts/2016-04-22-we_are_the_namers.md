In a departure from the common theme of my blog, and what must unquestionably
have been a fit of insanity, I temporarily forgot that I am not a poet and
wrote some words on how I feel about my profession:

```
We descend upon digital chaos
to give it form and purpose
Like an army of godlings
sent by Alpha and Omega
to make life

Like the occultists of old
and shamans before them
We use the names to form the chaos
and incantations to give them meaning

Many methods and tools exist
arcane and otherwise
many different schools of thought
and things over which to squabble
but at the end there always is

the names

The names which Bind
The names which Shape
The names that imbue Meaning
and last we have
The names that grant
Control over the chaos

You may know us as the Programmer,
the Software Engineer,
the Hacker or the Coder,
and many other names besides,
but in truth these are abstractions.

We are namers, shapers of digital chaos
We build vast structures
of complexity upon complexity
We mold the domain to serve our purpose
but all upon the dual backs
of Names and Meaning

We are the namers.
```
